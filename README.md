# An-hourglass-on-a-chessboard
It is a program that fetches a video of a chessboard and implements a 3D figure in the form of an hourglass on it.

The video of the chessboard is retrieved from the desktop. And based on the values obtained after calibration, a 3D figure model in the form of an hourglass is implemented on the chessboard.
